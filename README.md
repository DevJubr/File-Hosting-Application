5. **File Expiration**:
   - Develop a scheduled task to remove anonymous files after 7 days.

6. **Design and UI**:
   - Design a minimalistic user interface for the application, focusing on a clean and intuitive user experience.

7. **Testing and Quality Assurance**:
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Perform security testing to safeguard user data.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to a web server or cloud platform of your choice.

9. **Documentation**:
